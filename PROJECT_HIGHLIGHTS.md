# Project Highlights

## 3 takeaways
- **Gender gap:** Women consistently show higher depression severity / distress across key indicators and segments.
- **Socioeconomic gradient:** Lower-income / unemployed groups show higher depression burden and distress patterns.
- **Cost signal:** Poorer self-reported mental health aligns with higher healthcare expenditures, suggesting higher cost burden with severity.
